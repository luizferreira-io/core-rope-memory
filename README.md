![Core rope memory module picture](picture.jpg)

This Core Rope Memory Module has 12 addresses x 8bit values (96 bits total). You can select the address by rotating a rotary switch, and the bits of the stored value will be displayed in the top lights. Its operation depends on a 12v supply and a 2khz signal with an amplitude close to 3v.
